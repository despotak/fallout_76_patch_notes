/u/despotak notes on legendaries: This is my understanding of the new legendary drop system. LL_EpicChance_Boss_ECON was 100%. Now it is based on level and it maxes at 33%. So legendary mobs DO NOT a guaranteed legendary drop any more. Our best chance is 33%. They did tweak the maximum tier legendaries you can get from some lower level bosses and a few additional normal llo, but that's it. In general, this look like a 66% reduction for the legendary drop at best. I may be reading those totally wrong, so please, anyone that has some experience with xEdit, take a look and report back.  
**Edit:** I was informed that Epic chance in Fallout 4 had to do with what modifications a drop would have, not with the chance of being legendary or not. I will investigate more.

##F.A.Q
**Q: Will you continue provide such changelogs for each version going forwards?**
>*I will try my best to, but free time is scarce. I make an open invitation to anyone that is interested and knows how to diff this and the other files to contact me, so we can create an even more expansive changlog.*  

**Q: Why is the lead extractor still giving me scrap instead of ore?**
>*Because I am a little lazy bastard that didn't go through the list of extractors to double check that they are all changed. It only affects the Aluminum, Nuclear, Gold, Copper, Crystal, Coal and Titanium extractors.*

**Q: What is the new "leveled legendary drop system"?**
>*I didn't have the time to "decrypt" the new system and how it is interconnected, but there are 5 new globals by the name "LL_EpicChance_Boss_Dynamic_Lvl***x***0_ECON" that ties in with the "LLS_Creature_Boss__***Size***_Dynamic_Lvl***x***0". I'll try to go over them this afternoon if a get some free time.*

***Q: Is the fusion core production rate a typo?***
> *Not from my part. The value of the production tick changed from "0.083500" to "1.252500" hours. I believe that there is a displaced decimal point there, but I cannot say if it was in the before or the after value.*

**Q: What are the holiday specials?**
>*In River Song's voice*
>>*Spoilers!*
