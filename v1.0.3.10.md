## Official Bethesda Patch notes

### Planned changes (notes released 27/11/18)

> **December 11, 2018**
>
> The next update after December 4 is currently planned for the following week. Like previous patches, it will include a variety of bug fixes, but we're also planning to bring some more notable changes and features to the game. You can catch a preview of these improvements below, and a full list of changes will be included in the December 11 patch notes.
>
> - **PC Additions:** A Push-to-Talk setting for Voice Chat, 21:9 resolution support, and a Field of View setting are all being implemented on PC with this update.
> - **SPECIAL Respec:** After level 50, you'll be able to choose between a new Perk Card, or moving a SPECIAL point you had previously allocated.
> - **C.A.M.P. Placement on Login:** Your C.A.M.P. will no longer be automatically blueprinted and stored if someone is occupying your location when you log into a server. Instead, you'll receive a notification that your space is occupied. If you decide to find a new home for your C.A.M.P. on that server, it will be free to do so. However, if you don't attempt to place down your C.A.M.P., you will be able to switch to a new server where that spot is vacant and your C.A.M.P. will be fully assembled and waiting for you.
> - **Bulldozer:** This is a new C.A.M.P. feature that will allow you to remove small trees, rocks, and other obstructions so it's easier to create and place your C.A.M.P. when and where you want it. You can also "Bulldoze" to clear these items from the surrounding area to make your C.A.M.P. feel more like home!

### Official Patch note (notes released 11/12/18)

> #### HIGHLIGHTS:
>
> Here are a few of the major changes coming with today's patch. Further below, you'll find more details about each:

> - **C.A.M.P. Placement Improvements:** You will now be notified when you log into a world and your current C.A.M.P. location is occupied by another player. If you stay in that world, you can place your C.A.M.P. back down for free. If you decide not to place your C.A.M.P. and join a new world where your space is unoccupied, it will be automatically placed in its original spot.
> - **SPECIAL Re-speccing:** Upon reaching level 51, and every level thereafter, you'll be able to choose whether you want to unlock a new Perk Card or reallocate one SPECIAL point.
> - **Push-to-Talk:** We've implemented a push-to-talk hotkey for Voice Chat on PC so that you can decide when to speak up and when to remain silent.
> - **New PC Settings:** We've added Field of View and Depth of Field sliders so that you can further customize your view in-game.
> - **21:9 Resolution Support:** On PC, you can catch an even wider view from those gorgeous Appalachian vistas, because Fallout 76 now supports monitors that use 21:9 aspect ratios.
