## Official Bethesda Patch notes

### Planned changes (notes released 07/02/19 and 14/02/19)

> We’ve been reading your feedback about Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen and there are a couple of changes coming in Patch 6 later this month that we’d like to preview for you this week:
>
> - **Sonic Scream Attack Frequency:** One of the most common points of feedback we receive about Scorchbeasts is how they feel like they’re using their Sonic Scream attack too frequently. In Patch 6, we’re increasing the timer between successive Sonic Scream volleys to a minimum of 10 seconds for Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen. Scorchbeasts and their Sonic Scream attacks will still be challenging, but this change should allow players more time to react in between volleys. Let us know how this feels once you’ve had a chance to play with this change following Patch 6 release. We’ll continue to monitor Sonic Scream and can make further adjustments as needed.
> - **Scorchbeast Queen Loot:** In Patch 6, we’re also planning to fix a bug affecting the Scorchbeast Queen’s loot list, which often results in receiving the same plan as loot even after multiple Queen kills. Once this fix is live, the Scorchbeast Queen will be able to drop a wider variety of plans from her loot list, which should also limit cases where players receive a duplicate plan. Additionally, we are also looking into ways we can make her loot list more “legendary” in the future. While we're still working on implementing that system, we will let you know as soon as we have more details to share.
> We know that some of you have shared lots of thoughts with us on Scorchbeast fights in general, and we’re discussing your feedback internally to see where we can make potential balance adjustments in the future, while maintaining the challenge inherent in taking on Appalachia’s deadliest denizens. We’re also working to make additional performance improvements during encounters with the Scorchbeast Queen, and we should have more to share on that in a future update.
>
> ---
>
> Patch 6 is anticipated to release next week and planned for simultaneous launch on Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4. This will be the last update ahead of Wild Appalachia, which will be supported by Patch 7. Sticking to 6, we are still compiling our full patch notes to provide to you once that update is available, but in our tradition, we wanted to share with you some of the larger fixes we’re working on.
>
> - **Stash Limit Increase to 800** – We know this continues to be a big one. Next week, we are raising the Stash limit from 600 to 800 pounds. Like last time, we are constantly evaluating storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at the expense of server stability. We hope this additional increase to 800 pounds will help you store even more of the awesome item’s you’ve found in the Wasteland!
> - **The M79 Grenade Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as Heavy Weapons** – A fix is being made to properly label the M79 Grenade Launcher and Auto Grenade Launcher as Heavy Weapons. They will also now correctly benefit from all Heavy Weapons perks except for Heavy Gunner, as we believe it makes more sense for these weapons to benefit from the Demolitions Expert perk. Boom!
> - **Accidentally Damaging another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer tag you as WANTED** – From our Known Issues list, players who accidentally shoot, hit, or disturb another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer become WANTED and viewed as engaging in PvP. Instead you must actively work to be malicious to another player and DESTROY their C.A.M.P. objects for it to be considered a PvP action and become marked as WANTED. We will closely monitor player feedback to this change.
> - **Player Icons now display in more areas throughout the game** – Once Patch 6 arrives, hovering over a player on the map will now display their player icon, and Workshops will display their owners’ player icons, too. Additionally, when viewing a turret created by another player, you’ll now be able to see the owner’s name and player icon in the turret’s nameplate.
> - **Quest containers during the Feed the People and Path to Enlightenment events now only accept quest items** – With this fix, players can no longer accidentally transfer items from their inventories into these quest containers. As a result, you should now be able to complete these events without fear of losing non-quest items.

### Official Patch note (notes released 19/02/19)

> We’re releasing Patch 6 today, which includes an increase to stash size, balance and design changes, and another large wave of bug fixes, many of which were reported by players in the Fallout 76 community. As always, this is all possible thanks to your support and feedback for the game, please keep sharing your thoughts and bug reports with us! Take a look at some of the highlights from Patch 6, and then continue on to read about the rest of the changes coming with today’s update.
>
> ---
>
> ### Patch Highlights
>
> - **Increased Stash Limit:** We’ve once again buffed up maximum Stash size, this time from 600 to 800 pounds, so that you can store even more goodies from your adventures in Appalachia.
> - **Player Icon Display:** Player icons will now display whenever you hover over a player or an owned Workshop on the Map, as well as when you view Turrets created by someone else.
> - **Scorchbeast Attacks:** We’ve reduced the frequency of Scorchbeast Sonic Scream attacks, so you have a little more time to react between volleys.
> - **Wanted:** We’ve made an adjustment so that players must now destroy objects in another player’s C.A.M.P. or Workshop to become Wanted, which should reduce cases of accidental crime.
> - **Workshops:** You can now contest a Workshop that’s owned by another player from anywhere inside the Workshop’s build area, which should make it easier to attempt to contest a Workshop, even if it’s been barricaded by the owner.  
>
> ---
>
> ### Patch Version
>
> Download sizes for today’s patch will be approximately 4.5 GB for consoles, and around 3.5 GB for PC. 
>
> - **PC:**  1.0.6.0
> - **PS4:** 1.0.6.0
> - **Xbox:** 1.0.6.0
>
> ---
>
> ### General
>
> - **Server Maintenance:** As we work on world servers that have been running for a long time and hitting some lag issues, we’ll be performing maintenance on those servers more frequently. You may receive an in-game message alerting you to this maintenance when it occurs, and you may be asked to join another world. This should improve the play experience for everyone during your adventures in Appalachia.
>
> ### Balance and Design
>
> - **Power Armor:** The amount of springs required to craft and repair level 25, 35, and 45 Excavator Power Armor Legs has been significantly reduced.
> - **Weapons:** Flare Guns have been removed from the legendary weapon list, as they can’t benefit from legendary mods.
>
> ### C.A.M.P., Crafting, and Workshops
>
> - **Stash Limit:** The storage limit for the stash has been increased from 600 to 800 pounds.
>   - **Dev Note:** We’ve been reading your feedback that the current stash limit of 600 lbs could use an additional increase, and after some investigation found that we could offer some more storage space in the Stash.
> - **C.A.M.P. Placement:** If a player’s current C.A.M.P. location is occupied upon joining a world, a message will now display which gives them option to stay in the current world or attempt to join a new one.
>   - If the player chooses to find another world, they will be removed from the current world and matchmaking will attempt to place them in a new one. 
>   - This process can be repeated if the player’s C.A.M.P. location happens to also be occupied in the new world. 
> - **Workshops:** Players no longer need to interact with claimed Workshops directly to contest ownership, and Workshops can now be contested and captured from anywhere within the build area.
>   - **Dev Note:** The ability to contest a claimed Workshop is intended and encouraged behavior as part of Workshop design. This change should prevent situations where a Workshop owner could prevent others from attempting to contest it without becoming Wanted by destroying something or picking a lock to reach the Workshop.
>
> ### Enemies
>
> - **Scorchbeasts:** Increased the timer between successive Sonic Scream volleys to 10 seconds for Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen in order to reduce the frequency of these attacks.
>   - **Dev Note:** This change should help players have some more time to react between Sonic Scream volleys. We’ve also been reading lots of feedback about Scorchbeasts in general that the community has been sharing, and we’re looking into further improvements and balance changes we can bring to them in the future. 
>
> ### PVP
>
> - **Wanted:** Damaging a C.A.M.P. or workshop object created by another player no longer causes the attacker to become Wanted. The object must now be completely destroyed by the attacker in order to flag them as Wanted.
>   - **Dev Note:** We’ve received feedback from players who felt that it was too easy to become Wanted accidentally by damaging others’ C.A.M.P. and Workshop objects. We agree and made this change to help limit cases where a stray bullet could result in a bounty on your head. 
>
> ### Sound
>
> - **Sound Effects:** Pulling the pin on a grenade to prime it before throwing now play audible sound effects for nearby players.
> - **Map:** Sound effects now play when placing or moving custom Map markers.
>
> ### User Interface
>
> - **Player Icons:** Hovering over a player’s name on the Map will now display their current player icon.
> - **Player Icons:** Hovering over an owned Workshop on the Map will now display the current owner’s player icon.
> - **Turrets:** Viewing a Turret placed by another player in their C.A.M.P. or at a Workshop will now display the owner’s name and player icon in the Turret’s nameplate.
> - **Voice Chat:** The color of Voice Chat speaker icons on player nameplates now update based on that player’s current status: Neutral players display a pale-yellow icon, Allies display gold, and Hostile and Wanted display red.
>
> ---
>
> ### Bug Fixes
>
> ##### Performance and Stability
>
> - **Loading:** Addressed an issue that could cause controls to lock up if the player opened the Pip-Boy immediately after encountering a loading screen.

> - **Performance:** Addressed an issue that could cause hitching while scrapping items.
> - **Performance:** Attempting to craft many items at very high speed will now result in a delay of up to 1 second between subsequent crafting attempts after the first few. This was done to help improve server performance and should not affect normal crafting.
> - **Performance:** Addressed an issue that could impact server performance when scrapping a large number of items in rapid succession.
> - **Performance:** Addressed an issue that could cause reduced framerates when many players were firing weapons simultaneously in the same area.

>
> ##### Art and Graphics
>
> - **Apparel:** Hair no longer clips through the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit helmet.
> - **Apparel:** Underarmor no longer remains visible while wearing the Silver Shroud costume. 
> - **Emotes:** Fixed an issue causing reduced framerates during the Snowball Fight! Emote’s animation.
> - **Enemies:** Fixed an issue that could cause a second head to appear on a specific Scorched variant after decapitating it via headshot.

> - **Nuke Code Pieces:** Letters and Numbers displayed by Nuke Code Pieces will no longer appear misaligned on pickup.
> - **Perks:** The throwing arc displayed by the Fire in the Hole perk now remains visible if the player moves while holding a fragmentation grenade.
> - **Photomode:** Returning to first-person view after exiting Photomode with a ranged weapon equipped no longer causes the character model’s hands to appear offset or dark graphic effects to appear onscreen.
>
> ##### C.A.M.P., Crafting, and Workshops
>
> - **Blueprints:** Blueprints containing a mirror ball can now be placed correctly and no longer cause an “Object is floating.” error message to display.
> - **Blueprints:** Attempting to place a blueprint containing objects that have been placed on shelves no longer causes an “Object needs support” error message to display.

> - **C.A.M.P.:** Fixed an issue that could cause a C.A.M.P. dialog to display to a new character before they had placed their C.A.M.P. for the first time.
> - **Crafting:** Fixed an issue that could prevent items from being crafted or repaired despite having the required materials if those materials were split between the inventory and stash.
> - **Crafting:** Players who have exceeded the absolute weight limit of 1,500 lbs plus their current maximum carry weight are now correctly notified that they are unable to craft items while over the limit.

> - **Exploit:** Addressed an exploit that could allow items to be duplicated if a blueprint failed to save properly.

> - **Mothman:** Fixed an issue in which Mothman would not leave the area when approached or respond to attacks.
>
> ##### Items
>
> - **Apparel:** The Clean Clown Outfit now correctly counts toward completion of the "Kill Wendigos" side mission at Freddie's House of Scares.
> - **Apparel:** The Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit can no longer be equipped or unequipped while wearing Power Armor 
> - **Apparel:** The Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit outfit has been separated into two pieces - the body piece and the upper helmet.
>   - **Dev Note:** For the moment, the upper helmet, when not worn with the body piece, looks to be floating partly from the player character. This is temporary until we can rework the helmet itself. This was a necessary change to prevent poor interactions with Power Armor and underarmor. Players who already own the Rocketsuit, will automatically have access to craft the helmet.
> - **Armor:** The Punishing legendary effect no longer reflects “slap” damage dealt by another player. This should prevent cases where a player wearing Punishing armor could become Wanted unintentionally due to reflected damage that killed their attacker.

> - **Power Armor:** Fixed an issue that could allow Power Armor pieces with Atomic Shop paints applied to be transferred into containers.
> - **Weapons:** The M79 Grenade Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as heavy weapons, and correctly benefit from all heavy weapons perks except Heavy Gunner, as they benefit from Demolitions Expert instead.
>
> ##### Perks
>
> - **Last Laugh:** Explosive Bait is no longer dropped on death while the Last Laugh perk is equipped.

>
> ##### User Interface
>
> - **C.A.M.P.:** A player’s name will now correctly appear onscreen when viewing their C.A.M.P., even if that player is not nearby.
> - **Controls:** Plugging in a controller after launching Fallout 76 on PC using a keyboard and mouse no longer causes the button indicators for interactable objects, like containers or workbenches, to disappear until the client is relaunched.
> - **Controls:** Pressing the Quick Swap key (Default: Left D-pad) after the current weapon breaks now correctly swaps to an alternate weapon.
> - **Crosshairs:** Fixed an issue causing crosshairs to expand and contract incorrectly for players running the game using 21:9 aspect ratios.
> - **Game Camera:** Changing the face preset in the Change Appearance menu outside of Vault 76 no longer causes the camera to show an unintended angle in third-person view. 
> - **Holotapes:** Attempting to play a blank terminal holotape no longer causes the Pip-Boy to display a blank screen.

> - **Teams:** Attempting to join a teammate in a world from the main menu using the social menu no longer causes a message to display stating that they will be removed from the team.
> - **Teams:** Fixed an issue that could prevent team members from loading into a world with the team leader after the leader selected “Play”.
> - **Teams:** Fixed an issue in which the "Play with Team" option on the Main Menu became non-functional when attempting to rejoin teammates in a world following a crash or disconnect.
> - **Transfer Menu:** The transfer bar now correctly stops at 1 when scrolling to reduce the transfer quantity.
> - **Voice Chat:** The voice chat speaker icon now correctly appears in player nameplates, in team chat, and in the area chat list when a player is speaking.
