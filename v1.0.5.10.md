## Official Bethesda Patch notes

### Planned changes (notes released 17/01/19 and 24/01/19)

> ##### LATEST ON PATCH 5
>
> Early feedback from all of you on the latest patches has been very positive. It continues to help us to squash bugs with Super Sledge-like authority in future updates. Keep the awesome feedback coming – it’s making a big difference!
>
> We’re still targeting the end of the month for Patch 5, which will have another big wave of fixes. As a change moving forward, we will be working to make sure that Inside the Vault is the first place you see Patch Notes released. Patch 5 notes won’t be finalized until later in the month, but we want to give some more information on a couple planned changes for Patch 5.
> - **(UPDATED) Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods:** The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage ~~and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. **Note:** This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. **They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes.** Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes.
> - **Mod Scrapping No More:** We are aware of the aggravation involving mods being accidentally scrapped. Patch 5 will be implementing a fix so that loose weapon and armor mods must be scrapped manually to be used in crafting and repair.
>
> ---
> 
> ##### PATCH 5 DETAILS
> We’re still targeting the end of January for the release of Patch 5. In addition to the changes we previewed in the last [Inside the Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019), we’re pleased to share that we’re swatting another massive round of bugs with this patch, and implementing a number of changes based on feedback that players like you have shared with us on the forums, reddit, and social media, including:
>
> - Hotkey improvements for AZERTY keyboard layouts, which should help French-speaking players have an easier time when constructing their C.A.M.P.s.
> - A "(Known)" tag will now appear next to recipes and plans you’ve already learned in Vendor and player inventories, and trade menus.
> - The Traveling Pharmacy Perk will now correctly reduce the weight of RadAway and other Chems.
> - Early Warnings quest progress will no longer become stuck when crafting Upgraded Motors, and logging out after crafting Upgraded Motors will no longer reset the quest tracker to 0/5.
> - And much more!

### Official Patch note (notes released 29/01/19)

> #### General
>
> - Performance: Several additional improvements have been made to in-game performance.
> - Stability: The Fallout 76 game client and servers have received additional stability improvements.
>
> #### Balance Changes
>
> - **Perks:** The damage bonuses provided by each rank of the Demolition Expert perk have been reduced from +20%/40%/60%/80%/100% to +20%/30%/40%/50%/60% to match other weapon perk damage bonuses.
> - **Perks:** The condition loss bonuses provided by each rank of the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks have been reduced from 30%/60%/90% to 20%/40%/60%, and their repair bonuses have also been reduced, to match the Power Patcher perk.
>   - **Dev Note:** In looking at the Demolition Expert, White Knight, and Licensed Plumber perks, we felt they have so far been overperforming in their current roles, and we wanted to bring them more in line with similar perks to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks.
> - **Weapons:** The Explosive legendary mod’s damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +20% of base weapon damage, with explosive radius damage.
> - **Weapons:** The Two Shot legendary effect’s damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +25% of base weapon damage.
>   - **Dev Note:** As mentioned in a previous Inside the Vault article, both the explosive mod and two shot weapons could result in dealing very high amounts of damage, and this was compounded if two shot and explosive were combined. We’ve decided to tone both of these damage bonuses back.
> - **Weapons:** Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
>   - **Dev Note:** The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.
>
> #### C.A.M.P., Crafting, and Workshops
>
> - **Scrapping:** Loose weapon and armor mods are now protected from autoscrapping when crafting. However, they can still be scrapped manually if a player wants to break them down into scrap components.
> - **Turrets:** An “(Owned)” tag will now appear next to the names of Turrets a player has built in their C.A.M.P. or a workshop.
>
> #### Design and Gameplay
>
> - **Carry Weight:** Is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character’s current maximum carry weight.
>   - For example: If your carry weight limit is 210 pounds, then your maximum limit is 1,710 pounds.
>   - Characters will be unable to exceed this new weight limit moving forward.
>   - Characters who already exceed this limit will be unable to add any additional items or caps to their inventories until they have reduced their carry weight below the cap.
>   - **Dev Note:** These limits exist primarily to keep servers from performing poorly, which can happen when we have too many items in the game world. They also play role in helping to regulate the in-game economy. We do recognize the desire to be able to own more of the cool items that we have in the game, and we are looking into a variety of solutions, including increasing the stash size. We will be sure to talk more about this when they are ready.
> - **Cap Stashes:** To help address cap exploits, caps stashes have been turned into containers, which allows them to properly reset and provide players with instanced loot.
> - **Plans and Recipes:** When viewing a plan or recipe in a menu, a “(Known)” tag will now appear next to the names of recipes and plans the player has already learned.
> - **Vendors:** Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans.
>   - The appearance of many Plans and Recipes in Vendor inventories is based on player level and they will show up once the proper level has been reached.
>   - Additional structural Plans for wall sets, power connectors, doors, generators, and water purifiers have also been added to some Vendors.
>   - **(Added Jan 29)** Since many Plans and Recipes can now be sourced reliably from Vendors, we've also increased their Cap costs accordingly.
>   - **(Added Jan 29) Dev Note:** Recipe and Plan prices were originally based on the rarity of showing up in a Vendor’s inventory. Guaranteeing their appearance significantly increased the availability of most plans and recipes and we’ve increased their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others’ equipment for a cheaper price.
>
> #### PVP
>
> - **Hunter/Hunted:** A server-wide message will now appear when a player joins the Hunter/Hunted queue.
>   - This message will only be displayed once per player to avoid spam.
>   - An additional server-wide message will be displayed when Hunter/Hunted is ready to begin in order to give other players a final chance to join.
>
> #### Quests and Events
>
> - **Belly of the Beast:** A new “Ultracite Power Armor” entry has been added to Taggerdy’s Terminal on the top floor of Fort Defiance, offering Ultracite Power Armor plans to those who read it.
> - **First Contact:** A new miscellaneous objective will now appear upon reaching the Overseer's C.A.M.P. for the first time, prompting the player to place a C.A.M.P. of their own.
> - **Gauley Mine:** A new miscellaneous objective will now appear at Gauley Mine to introduce players to Ore Deposits.
> - **Monster Mash:** The amount of XP awarded per round during this event has been reduced from 350 to 100.
>
> ---
>
> #### Bug Fixes

>
> - **Lighting:** Lighting no longer flickers throughout Arktos Pharma.
> - **Apparel:** Fixed an issue that could cause a character’s legs to show through the Rose Dress while it is equipped.
>
> ##### C.A.M.P., Crafting, and Workshops
>

> - **Blueprints:** Addressed an issue preventing players from placing a stored blueprint containing posts that were placed partially underground when the blueprint was originally saved.

> - **Learn Cooking Recipes:** This challenge will now recognize many additional cooking recipes when they are learned for the first time. Retroactive credit will not be awarded for recipes learned prior to today’s patch, but that is planned for a future update.

> - **Monorail Elevator:** Fixed an issue that prevented the Monorail Elevator near the edge of Cranberry Bog from taking players to the top floor.
> - **Performance:** The Scorched Earth event has received optimization improvements.
> - **Performance:** On laptops with more than one graphics card, Fallout 76 will now default to using the dedicated graphics card rather than an integrated card.

> - **Health Bonuses:** A player with very low health who unequips an item that provides bonus health will no longer be instantly killed if removing that item that would cause their health to drop to or below 0.
> - **Paper Bags:** Fixed multiple issues in which transferring items into an empty paper bag as the bag was despawning caused those items to become lost.
> - **Pip-Boy:** Fixed a rare issue that could cause a character’s Pip-Boy to go missing.

>
> ##### Perks

> - **Cap Collector:** Now requires players to search caps stashes, much like other perks that grant a search option for containers.
> - **Exploit:** Addressed an exploit affecting the Curator perk.
> - **Fireproof:** Flame attack damage reduction provided by the Fireproof perk now correctly applies to Molotov fire damage.
> - **Serendipity:** A notification will now appear on-screen and sound effects will play whenever the Serendipity perk’s effects are triggered.

>

>

> - **Stealth:** Addressed an issue in which stealth damage bonuses could still be applied by a sneaking player’s attacks during PVP even that player was within their target’s direct line of sight.
> - **Wanted:** Fixed an issue that could cause the bounty amount for a Wanted player to appear halved on the map when approaching that player in the game world.
>
> ##### Quests and Events
>
> - **Breach and Clear:** The Meteoric Sword now correctly has a slim chance to spawn in containers during the Breach and Clear event.
> - **Early Warnings:** Quest progress will no longer become stuck when crafting Upgraded Motors and logging out after crafting Upgraded Motors will no longer reset the quest tracker to 0/5.
> - **Events:** Fixed an issue that could allow a player to simultaneously join two different events.
> - **Events:** Fast traveling after joining an event will now correctly remove the player from that event and will no longer prevent them from joining proximity event at their fast travel destination.
> - **Flavors of Mayhem:** Rose will no longer occasionally play unrelated voiceover lines when attempting to turn in Flavors of Mayhem, and the player is no longer prevented from correctly completing the quest.

> - **Map:** Character levels no longer appear truncated on the map for players over level 100.

If players attempt to make multiple trades too quickly, a new "Trade failed due to frequency, wait a moment and try again." error message will now display rather than the previous “Trade Failed on Server” message.

> - **Tutorials:** New players will now receive a tutorial message informing them of the Change Appearance option in the Main Menu.
> - **VATS:** Now selects targets more consistently across different field of view (FOV) values. For example, VATS will no longer target enemies that are visible in peripheral vision at high FOV values, but would be off-screen at default FOV values. This fix will help prevent VATS from providing an advantage to players who use high FOV settings.
> - **VATS:** Fixed an issue that could cause the VATS interface to rapidly flicker on and off.
> - **Voice Chat:** Fixed an issue preventing the speaker icon from appearing to others while a player is speaking over voice chat.
