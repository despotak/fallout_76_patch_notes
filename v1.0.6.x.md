## Official Bethesda Patch notes

### Planned changes (notes released 07/02/19 and 14/02/19)

> We’ve been reading your feedback about Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen and there are a couple of changes coming in Patch 6 later this month that we’d like to preview for you this week:
>
> - **Sonic Scream Attack Frequency:** One of the most common points of feedback we receive about Scorchbeasts is how they feel like they’re using their Sonic Scream attack too frequently. In Patch 6, we’re increasing the timer between successive Sonic Scream volleys to a minimum of 10 seconds for Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen. Scorchbeasts and their Sonic Scream attacks will still be challenging, but this change should allow players more time to react in between volleys. Let us know how this feels once you’ve had a chance to play with this change following Patch 6 release. We’ll continue to monitor Sonic Scream and can make further adjustments as needed.
> - **Scorchbeast Queen Loot:** In Patch 6, we’re also planning to fix a bug affecting the Scorchbeast Queen’s loot list, which often results in receiving the same plan as loot even after multiple Queen kills. Once this fix is live, the Scorchbeast Queen will be able to drop a wider variety of plans from her loot list, which should also limit cases where players receive a duplicate plan. Additionally, we are also looking into ways we can make her loot list more “legendary” in the future. While we're still working on implementing that system, we will let you know as soon as we have more details to share.
> We know that some of you have shared lots of thoughts with us on Scorchbeast fights in general, and we’re discussing your feedback internally to see where we can make potential balance adjustments in the future, while maintaining the challenge inherent in taking on Appalachia’s deadliest denizens. We’re also working to make additional performance improvements during encounters with the Scorchbeast Queen, and we should have more to share on that in a future update.
>

>
> Patch 6 is anticipated to release next week and planned for simultaneous launch on Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4. This will be the last update ahead of Wild Appalachia, which will be supported by Patch 7. Sticking to 6, we are still compiling our full patch notes to provide to you once that update is available, but in our tradition, we wanted to share with you some of the larger fixes we’re working on.
>
> - **Stash Limit Increase to 800** – We know this continues to be a big one. Next week, we are raising the Stash limit from 600 to 800 pounds. Like last time, we are constantly evaluating storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at the expense of server stability. We hope this additional increase to 800 pounds will help you store even more of the awesome item’s you’ve found in the Wasteland!
> - **The M79 Grenade Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as Heavy Weapons** – A fix is being made to properly label the M79 Grenade Launcher and Auto Grenade Launcher as Heavy Weapons. They will also now correctly benefit from all Heavy Weapons perks except for Heavy Gunner, as we believe it makes more sense for these weapons to benefit from the Demolitions Expert perk. Boom!
> - **Accidentally Damaging another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer tag you as WANTED** – From our Known Issues list, players who accidentally shoot, hit, or disturb another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer become WANTED and viewed as engaging in PvP. Instead you must actively work to be malicious to another player and DESTROY their C.A.M.P. objects for it to be considered a PvP action and become marked as WANTED. We will closely monitor player feedback to this change.
> - **Player Icons now display in more areas throughout the game** – Once Patch 6 arrives, hovering over a player on the map will now display their player icon, and Workshops will display their owners’ player icons, too. Additionally, when viewing a turret created by another player, you’ll now be able to see the owner’s name and player icon in the turret’s nameplate.
> - **Quest containers during the Feed the People and Path to Enlightenment events now only accept quest items** – With this fix, players can no longer accidentally transfer items from their inventories into these quest containers. As a result, you should now be able to complete these events without fear of losing non-quest items.
