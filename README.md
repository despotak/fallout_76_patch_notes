## Introducing [Bugthesda - Community Issue Tracker for Bethesda games](https://github.com/bugthesda)

While Bethesda asked the community to report bugs and propose feature requests, they never gave us the right tools to do so in an organized fashion that will help both Bethesda and the community...

So in the classic Bethesda fan style, I took up the mantle to at least try and bring out what they should had done from the beginning...

Bugthesda is a github "organization" were community members can open Issues (bug reports, feature requests, etc.) for games developed by Bethesda Game Studios. Right now there is only a repository for Fallout 76, since I do not want to interfere with the bug tracker the guys over [AFK Mods](https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/) (they guys that bring us the Unofficial Patches), and cause double duty.

This endeavor requires the participation of the community and it will need some people to take moderation roles to keep it in check. So, is you are interested, send me a message.

P.S. You will need a github account to be able to post and comment.
