## Official Bethesda Patch notes

### Planned changes (notes released 09/01/19)

>**January 14**
>
>Last week we mentioned that we would be starting the new year with new patches. The first of those will be coming January 14. Like the December 11 update, this patch will address many issues raised by the community as well as continue focus on improving performance and stability.
>
>We'll have the patch notes available to go along with the patch, but some of the things we're planning to address include issues with several Challenges and quests, various fixes to a number of Perks and weapons, and tackling various exploits we've seen.
>
>**Update**: Containing more than 150 fixes, the patch will now land on PC beginning tomorrow and consoles early next week. Similar to what we did with the December 11 patch, placing it on PC first will give us time to make further adjustments as needed before releasing the patch on consoles. We will communicate if there are any further diversions from the schedule. PC players, please note that tomorrow, January 10 at 9am ET Fallout 76 will be receiving this update at which time we will also post the patch notes. Thank you!
