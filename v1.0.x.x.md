## Official Bethesda Patch notes

### Planned changes (notes released 27/11/18)

**December 11, 2018**

The next update after December 4 is currently planned for the following week. Like previous patches, it will include a variety of bug fixes, but we&#39;re also planning to bring some more notable changes and features to the game. You can catch a preview of these improvements below, and a full list of changes will be included in the December 11 patch notes.

- **PC Additions:** A Push-to-Talk setting for Voice Chat, 21:9 resolution support, and a Field of View setting are all being implemented on PC with this update.
- **SPECIAL Respec:** After level 50, you&#39;ll be able to choose between a new Perk Card, or moving a SPECIAL point you had previously allocated.
- **C.A.M.P. Placement on Login:** Your C.A.M.P. will no longer be automatically blueprinted and stored if someone is occupying your location when you log into a server. Instead, you&#39;ll receive a notification that your space is occupied. If you decide to find a new home for your C.A.M.P. on that server, it will be free to do so. However, if you don&#39;t attempt to place down your C.A.M.P., you will be able to switch to a new server where that spot is vacant and your C.A.M.P. will be fully assembled and waiting for you.
- **Bulldozer:** This is a new C.A.M.P. feature that will allow you to remove small trees, rocks, and other obstructions so it&#39;s easier to create and place your C.A.M.P. when and where you want it. You can also &quot;Bulldoze&quot; to clear these items from the surrounding area to make your C.A.M.P. feel more like home!
