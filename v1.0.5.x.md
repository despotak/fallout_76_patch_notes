## Official Bethesda Patch notes

### Planned changes (notes released 17/01/18)

> ##### LATEST ON PATCH 5
>
> Early feedback from all of you on the latest patches has been very positive. It continues to help us to squash bugs with Super Sledge-like authority in future updates. Keep the awesome feedback coming – it’s making a big difference!
>
> We’re still targeting the end of the month for Patch 5, which will have another big wave of fixes. As a change moving forward, we will be working to make sure that Inside the Vault is the first place you see Patch Notes released. Patch 5 notes won’t be finalized until later in the month, but we want to give some more information on a couple planned changes for Patch 5.
> - **(UPDATED) Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods:** The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage ~~and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. **Note:** This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. **They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes.** Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes.
> - **Mod Scrapping No More:** We are aware of the aggravation involving mods being accidentally scrapped. Patch 5 will be implementing a fix so that loose weapon and armor mods must be scrapped manually to be used in crafting and repair.
